              settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in

              The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies to
              the arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single,
              neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the State of Delaware,
              or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language.
              The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent
              jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when
              authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be entered as a
              judgement and enforced in any court of law. At your request,
              hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the
              arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on
              briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action
              or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs
              and attorneys’ fees.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose
              filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will
              reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs
              would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you
              were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional
              fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration
              administrator’s rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing,
              each party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such
              as attorney fees that the party may incur.

              We do not own or control the underlying software protocols which
              govern the operation of Digital Assets. Generally, the underlying
              protocols are open source, and anyone can use, copy, modify, and
              distribute them. We assume no responsibility for the operation of
              the underlying protocols and we are not able to guarantee the
              functionality or security of network operations. In particular,
              the underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in
              operating rules (including “forks”). Any such material operating
              changes may materially affect the availability, value,
              functionality, and/or the name of such digital currency. P2p does
              not control the timing and features of these material operating
              changes. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of
              upcoming operating changes and you must carefully consider
              publicly available information and information that may be
              provided by P2p in determining whether to continue to use the

              temporarily suspending operations for the involved digital

              reasonable efforts to provide you notice of its response to any
              material operating change; however, such changes are outside of
              our control and may occur without notice to P2p. Our response to
              any material operating change is subject to our sole discretion

                  Offers from P2p counterparties have their own terms and
                  conditions and each offer will vary in exchange rate, speed of
                  exchange, and other terms and conditions imposed by a Seller.
                  By accepting a Seller’s offer you agree to be bound by the
                  terms and conditions of that offer. The terms and conditions
                  specified by the Seller are valid in all cases except when
                  they contradict or violate this Agreement, are illegal, are
                  unreasonable or otherwise difficult to comply with (as

                  PAYMENT UNLESS YOU HAVE FOLLOWED ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              P2p Pay. P2p has authorized certain merchants to accept P2p as a
              payment method for purchases of goods and services online (the
              “Authorized Merchants”). You may pay an Authorized Merchant by
              selecting the “P2p Pay” option at check-out or at the time of
              payment. P2p Pay will direct you to our Marketplace to access the
              Digital Assets available in your account or connect you to a
              Seller. If you purchase Digital Assets from a Seller to complete
              the transaction, the terms set forth in Section 7.1 of this
              Agreement will apply.

              Authorized Merchant, you should resolve the dispute directly with
              that Authorized Merchant.

          DISPUTING TRANSACTIONS VIA P2p’S DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS
          <ol className={`${Classes.nestedList} mt-3`} type='i'>
            <li>
              Disputing Transactions. In most cases, the easiest way to settle a
              dispute is for Buyers and Sellers to communicate, work together to
              figure out what happened, and come to an agreeable solution. When
              a Buyer and a Seller cannot come to an agreeable solution, P2p’s
              support team (“P2p Support”) can help. Either party can initiate
              the dispute resolution process (“disputed transaction” or
              “dispute”) with respect to a transaction. Disputes can only be
              initiated on transactions that are marked as fully paid by the
              Buyer. Transactions that are not marked as fully paid by the
              Buyer, cancelled by the Buyer, automatically cancelled due to
              expiration of the timeframe set forth in the offer, already
              disputed and resolved or where the Seller has released the Digital
              Assets to the Buyer generally cannot be disputed, reversed, or
              altered.
            </li>

              Dispute Resolution Process. Below are the steps P2p Support takes
              in the event of a dispute.

                    Initiation{' '}
                    <p>
                      You can initiate a dispute by logging into your P2p
                      Account, opening the transaction you would like to dispute
                      and selecting the “dispute” button. The “dispute” button
                      will only appear active if the transaction has been marked
                      as fully paid by the Buyer. Once you initiate a dispute,
                      you will select the type of dispute from the options
                      presented and describe the issue giving rise to your
                      dispute.

                      The options presented for describing your dispute if you

                      <li>
                        Coinlocker (i.e. an unresponsive Buyer) – the Buyer has
                        marked the transaction as fully paid, but is
                        unresponsive and inactive.

                        gave rise to the dispute. The Buyer will be able to view
                        your description.

                  <p>
                    Once a dispute has been submitted, P2p Support will provide
                    the other party with notification by email and by sending a
                    message through the transaction chat feature available to
                    Buyers and Sellers in the Marketplace alerting such party
                    that a dispute has been initiated. If one of your
                    transactions is being disputed, P2p Support will tell you
                    which transaction is being disputed and why the transaction
                    is being disputed.

                    explanation of what happened. Include any evidence you have
                    to support your explanation, such as proof of payment, proof
                    of ownership or proof that you have or have not received
                    payment.

                  P2p Review
                  <p>
                    Disputed transactions will be investigated by P2p Support
                    and a decision will be made based upon evidence provided by
                    both parties. P2p Support resolves disputes by evaluating
                    various factors as described below in Section 8.

            </li>
            <li>
              Dispute Review. During a dispute review, P2p Support may give you
              instructions that you are required to follow. The instructions
              given to you may require you to provide additional evidence, such
              as additional ID verification, proof of payment, any photo, audio,
              or video evidence, or any other documents deemed relevant by P2p
              and may require you to provide such evidence within a specified
              timeframe. Failure to follow the instructions may lead to the
              dispute being resolved against you. P2p Support will typically
              provide notice of its decision via the transaction chat feature in
              the Marketplace within 30 days of receiving the dispute, but under
              some circumstances, it may take longer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unresponsiveness. When you are involved in a transaction, it is
              important that you remain active and available from the time the
              transaction is started to the time that the transaction is
              completed, canceled, or resolved. This means that you must be able
              to provide a response to a request by P2p Support in a disputed
              transaction within the time specified by P2p Support or you may be
              deemed as unresponsive and the dispute may be resolved against
              you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chargebacks. A party may face additional risks depending on the
              payment method used for the transaction even if P2p’s dispute
              resolution process finds in favor of such party. The dispute
              resolution process set forth in this Agreement is separate from
              any remedies a Buyer or Seller may have through the payment method
              used in connection with a transaction. P2p is not obligated to
              initiate or handle chargebacks and is not liable if a party
              reverses, charges back, or otherwise disputes a transaction via an
              avenue made available to the party through the payment method used
              in the transaction, including after a dispute is closed.

            <li>
              <p>
                Dispute Resolution. A disputed transaction is most commonly
                resolved by P2p Support moving the Digital Assets subject to the
                dispute to the Buyer or the Seller of the disputed transaction
                once the dispute resolution process is complete.

                Below are selected situations to provide you with insight as to
                how P2p may resolve a disputed transaction. This is not meant to
                be an exhaustive list. The resolution of any dispute will be
                impacted by the specific facts of the dispute and evidence
                provided by the users.

                  that the payment was made according to these instructions. It
                  is a violation of this Agreement for a Seller to refuse to

                  Seller’s terms and conditions as posted at the time the Buyer

              </ul>
              <p>
                If the Buyer or the Seller of a disputed transaction provides
                fraudulent information or fraudulent documents or makes false
                claims or otherwise uses deceptive tactics, the dispute may be
                immediately resolved against such user and such user’s account
                may be immediately suspended or terminated at the sole
                discretion of P2p Support.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some situations where neither party fulfills the criteria, or

                party has fulfilled the dispute resolution criteria in P2p’s
                sole and absolute discretion, P2p may decide to resolve the
                dispute by splitting the Digital Assets subject to the dispute
                between the Buyer and the Seller evenly or unevenly.

              notify us in writing by contacting P2p customer support no later
              than 10 calendar days after notice of P2p Support’s decision is
              delivered to you and provide us with sufficient details and
              evidence supporting your case for request. Your appeal should
              specifically identify how you believe P2p incorrectly resolved the
