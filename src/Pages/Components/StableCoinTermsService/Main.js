              <p>
                The P2P Stablecoin service is a referral mechanism that allows
                you, a qualifying P2P user, to enter into a peer-to-peer
                transaction with a pre-selected third party company (the
                "Stablecoin Counterparty"), chosen by P2P, for the exchange of
                your Bitcoin for a USD-equivalent amount of stablecoins, to be
                held by the Stablecoin Counterparty for your benefit. Through
                this model, P2P Stablecoin allows you to exit your Bitcoin
                position into the selected stablecoin.
              </p>

            <div className='mb-3'>
              <h3 className='text-info'>2. Referral Mechanism</h3>
              <p>
                The P2P Stablecoin service is a limited purpose referral
                mechanism available on the P2P platform. Upon indicating your
                interest in performing a P2P Stablecoin transaction, P2P will
                refer you to the Stablecoin Counterparty for the consummation of
                the transaction. You must then follow the provided prompts in
                order to submit your offer terms to the Stablecoin Counterparty.
                Should the Stablecoin Counterparty accept your offer terms, the
                transaction will be consummated between you and the Stablecoin
                Counterparty. As with the standard transactions conducted on its
                marketplace, P2P will have no involvement, control, power,
                discretion, or authority in the P2P Stablecoin transactions
                entered into or attempted between you and the Stablecoin
                Counterparty. P2P shall neither custody any stablecoins nor
                advise or instruct any P2P user to obtain such stablecoins.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Stablecoin Counterparty may have their own terms and
                conditions for the P2P Stablecoin service transactions, and the
                P2P Stablecoin service may vary in exchange rate, speed of
                exchange, and other terms and conditions imposed by the
                Stablecoin Counterparty (the "Stablecoin Counterparty Terms").
                By entering into a transaction with the Stablecoin Counterparty
                you agree to be bound by the Stablecoin Counterparty Terms. The
                Stablecoin Counterparty Terms are valid in all cases except when
                they contradict or violate the Agreement, these P2P Stablecoin
                Terms of Service, are illegal, are unreasonable or otherwise
                difficult to comply with (as determined in P2Pâ€™s sole and
                absolute discretion), or if you and the Stablecoin Counterparty
                consent to alter the Stablecoin Counterparty Terms. IT IS YOUR
                RESPONSIBILITY TO CAREFULLY READ THE STABLECOIN COUNTERPARTY
                TERMS AND FOLLOW THEM EXACTLY. IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THE
                STABLECOIN COUNTERPARTY TERMS, YOUR TRANSACTION MAY BE DENIED.
                NEVER ENTER INTO A P2P STABLECOIN SERVICE TRANSACTION UNLESS YOU
                HAVE FOLLOWED ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS LISTED. IF YOU FAIL TO
                FOLLOW THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, P2P MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIST
                YOU IN A DISPUTE PROCESS TO RECOVER YOUR FUNDS.
